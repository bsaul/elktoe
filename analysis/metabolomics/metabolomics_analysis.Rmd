# Preprocessing

* TBD at later time: 

# Analysis

* Dimension reduction
    * Wavelet filter 
    * Principal components 
    * supervised SVD 
* Independent components
    - Include covariates and estimates in IC algorithm?
    - or check ICs against covariates post-hoc?

SVD the observed $\mathbf{Y}_{n \times p}$:

\[
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{U}_{n \times m}\mathbf{D}_{m \times m}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{m \times p}
\]

Then:

\[
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}_{m \times m}\mathbf{S}_{m \times p}
\]
